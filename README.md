Water Me - Starter Code
==================================

The application consists of a list of plants with their names, type of plant, simple description, and when they need to be watered. When the user launches the application, they will be presented with that list displayed using a recylerview. Since the application is using the WorkManager API, the one work reqeust is to create a reminder for when the plant needs to be watered. Since the request is guranteed to execute, it does not matter if the application is in focus for the user. When it is time to water any of the plants on the list, a notification will be pushed to the user's device. After clicking on the notification, it will launch the application again.
